# Suricata_Cloud_Threat_Detection
In this lab, I deployed **Suricata**, a powerful open-source network threat detection engine, on my **Raspberry Pi 5 running Kali Linux**.

# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Homelab Projects

Welcome to my personal Cybersecurity Homelab repository! This space is where I document hands-on labs and real-world security configurations I've completed as part of my self-guided training journey into roles like SOC Analyst, Risk Analyst, and Security Operations.

## 🔍 What's Inside

This repo contains detailed Markdown reports (in human-readable language) for the following labs:

1. **SIEM Log Analysis & Alert Tuning (Splunk)**
2. **Vulnerability Management Workflow (Nessus)**
3. **Network Threat Detection (Suricata + Raspberry Pi 5)**
4. **Cloud Security Tools Overview (AWS CloudTrail, GuardDuty)** ← *Deprecated due to billing concerns*
5. **Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) Documentation** *(Coming Soon)*

Each lab showcases real work—from configuring routers and VLANs to writing detection rules and performing risk assessments.

## 🧠 Goal

Build a solid and practical foundation in cybersecurity using affordable hardware, open-source tools, and enterprise-grade configurations—while demonstrating my problem-solving, documentation, and technical skills.

## 💼 Why This Matters

This repo serves as my public portfolio for potential employers. It reflects my initiative, troubleshooting mindset, and ability to work through realistic security environments.
